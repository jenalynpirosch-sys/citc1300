        <h2>Raids</h2>

        <p>Blizzard and their dev team like to play with their food and run players ragged when it comes to raids they create. They're designed to foster team work, thought, and tears. With each new expansion, new raids are added, which means there's a race to complete them first on 3 different difficulties: normal, heroic, and mythic. We call it the race to world first and it's so much fun to watch (and participate when given the chance). Some of the largest guilds in the world stream their attempts, including both failures and wins, leaving the rest of us to bite our nails as we follow along with the process. 

        My other half and I like to watch Team Liquid - they're a house full of nerds who are dedicated to their (war)craft and they kick total butt. The energy is unmatched, and it rivals the excitement seen when folks watch college football or basketball. Below is one of their most watched videos.

            <h3>Icecrown Citadel</h3>

            <p>From the Wrath of the Lich King expansion comes the Icecrown Citadel. It has 12 bosses that will run you and your 10 or 25-man raid into the ground. Completing the raid with the final boss, The Lich King is a huge accomplishment. It's fun, challenging, and so incredibly cool. It'll forever be one of my favorites.

             I have vivid memories from the ICC days - I had a group of fun guildmates that I met in game. I'm still friends with a handful of them! I loved coming back from my favorite night club in 2010, a little tipsy, hopping into our Vent voice server and trying to take down The Lich King himself, Arthas. We wiped so many times, but it was so much fun that we (mostly) didn't care. I have a playlist that I created with all of the songs I'd have blaring during those times. My roommates hated me on the weekends, oops!
