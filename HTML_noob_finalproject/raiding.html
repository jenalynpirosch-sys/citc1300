            <h2>Raids</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Blizzard and their dev team like to play with their food and run players ragged when it comes to raids they create. 
                They're designed to foster teamwork, thought, and tears. With each new expansion, new raids are added, which means there's a race to complete them first on 3 different difficulties: normal, heroic, and mythic. 
                We call it the race to world first and it's so much fun to watch (and participate when given the chance). Some of the largest guilds in the world stream their attempts, including both failures and wins, leaving the rest of us to bite our nails as we follow along.
            </p>
            <p>
                My other half and I like to watch Team Liquid - they're a house full of nerds dedicated to their (war)craft and they kick total butt. The energy is unmatched, and it rivals the excitement seen when folks watch college football or basketball.

            <p>I'd also recommend checking out this Mythic Gul'Dan kill. This guild hit didn't hit world first, but it was still magical to watch. Goosebump inducing for sure!  I never ran it on mythic, but heroic was a total nightmare. I know we had some players walk after several wipes. It was so mechanic-heavy that you <i>had</i> to pay super close attention at all times. Such a satisfying kill once we got it.

            <h3>Icecrown Citadel</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                From the Wrath of the Lich King expansion comes the Icecrown Citadel. 
                It has 12 bosses that will run you and your 10 or 25-man raid into the ground. Completing the raid with the final boss, The Lich King, is a huge accomplishment. It's fun, challenging, and so incredibly cool. It'll forever be one of my favorites.

                I have vivid memories from the ICC days - I had a group of fun guildmates that I met in-game. 
                I'm still friends with a handful of them! I loved coming back from my favorite night club in 2010, a little tipsy, hopping into our Vent voice server and trying to take down The Lich King himself, Arthas. 
                We wiped so many times, but it was so much fun that we (mostly) didn't care. I have a playlist that I created with all of the songs I'd have blaring during those times. My roommates hated me on the weekends, oops!
