            <h2>Raids</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Blizzard’s dev team loves keeping players on their toes with challenging raids. Designed to foster teamwork, strategy, and plenty of tears, each new expansion introduces exciting new raids. Players race to complete them across three difficulties—Normal, Heroic, and Mythic—in what’s called the “Race to World First.” Watching these attempts is thrilling (and even more fun when you get to participate!). Some of the largest guilds stream their runs, showing both spectacular victories and epic fails, leaving the rest of us biting our nails along the way.

             My partner and I love watching Team Liquid—they’re a house full of dedicated (war)craft nerds who absolutely dominate. The energy they bring rivals even college football or basketball, and it’s a blast to follow along. Check out one of their most-watched videos below!

            <p>I'd also recommend checking out this Mythic Gul'Dan kill. This guild hit didn't hit world first, but it was still magical to watch. Goosebump inducing for sure!  I never ran it on mythic, but heroic was a total nightmare. I know we had some players walk after several wipes. It was so mechanic-heavy that you <i>had</i> to pay super close attention at all times. Such a satisfying kill once we got it.

            <h3>Icecrown Citadel</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                From the Wrath of the Lich King expansion comes Icecrown Citadel, home to 12 brutal bosses that will push your 10- or 25-man raid to the limit. Defeating the final boss, The Lich King, is a major achievement. Fun, challenging, and visually stunning, this raid will always remain one of my favorites.

                I have vivid memories from the ICC days with a group of fun guildmates I met in-game. I’m still friends with some of them today! I remember coming home from my favorite nightclub in 2010, a little tipsy, hopping onto our Vent voice server, and attempting to take down The Lich King, Arthas. We wiped countless times, but it was so much fun that we mostly didn’t care. I even made a playlist of all the songs I’d blast during those raids—much to the dismay of my roommates on weekends, oops!
