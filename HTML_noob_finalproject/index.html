        <h2>About The World of Warcraft</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> In the gorgeous World of Warcraft, you, the hero, work to save Azeroth from certain demise. The game truly is whatever you make it to be. As a champion of Azeroth, you can fight monsters, run dungeons with other players, or you can just collect pets, outfits (known as transmog), or mounts. Blizzard is also big on holidays and events - each week there's specialty content available that often has super cool rewards and achievements. Truly, there's so much content that even when you hit max level, theres still so much you can do. The game has a ton of 'replayability' for each and every player.

    We have a local record shop that has tons of cool things from comics to old gaming consoles to Pokemon cards and I found this relic there over the weekend. Whoever brought it in also included the discs needed for Vanilla and The Burning Crusade. Absolute steal for $2.99! I remember going to the midnight launches for both Wrath of the Lich King and Cataclysm. It was so much fun.

    This photo is from December 6th, 2010. I was sitting in my car at 11:55pm with the physical game because GameStop broke the street date (big no no!) by 10-ish minutes. I was SO thrilled that I had to break out my Blackberry to take a terrible grainy photo.

        <h3>Fresh Expansions, Fresh Gameplay</h3>
        <hr>

    <p>
        Blizzard has been releasing expansions (extra content) about about every two years - largely influenced by development timelines - keeping the game fresh and fun for all to enjoy. The expansions add new lands and continents to explore, stories to live, and sometimes even new races and classes to try out.
    <br>
    <br>
        I have played since Vanilla (that's what we call the base game from 2004, when it released in North America) and have played a good bit of each expansion. I'm always drawn in by new, shiny things as well as updated play mechanics and areas. The designers are incredible when it comes to creation and design. The game is just flat out beautiful.  My personal favorite expansions are Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm, and Legion. 
    <br>
    <br>
        Be sure to check out the cinematics for those expansions below!
