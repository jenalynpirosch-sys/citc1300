        <h2>About The World of Warcraft</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> In the gorgeous world of Azeroth, you—the hero—take on the challenge of saving it from certain doom. World of Warcraft is whatever you make it: you can fight monsters, run dungeons with friends, or just collect pets, outfits (known as transmog), and mounts. Blizzard also loves its holidays and events—every week brings special content with awesome rewards and achievements. Even at max level, there’s always something new to do. The game has endless replayability, offering something for every type of player.

    Over the weekend, I stumbled across a gem at our local record shop—a treasure trove of comics, old gaming consoles, and Pokémon cards. Among the finds was a real relic: the discs for Vanilla and The Burning Crusade. All for $2.99—an absolute steal! It instantly reminded me of the midnight launches for Wrath of the Lich King and Cataclysm. Those nights were pure magic, full of excitement, anticipation, and a little chaos—exactly what makes WoW so unforgettable.

    This photo was taken on December 6th, 2010. I was sitting in my car at 11:55 PM, clutching the physical copy of the game because GameStop had broken the street date (a major no-no!) by about ten minutes. I was so thrilled that I had to grab my Blackberry and snap a terribly grainy photo—because clearly, the world needed proof of my fangirl excitement in that very moment.

        <h3>Fresh Expansions, Fresh Gameplay</h3>
        <hr>

    <p>
        Blizzard has been releasing expansions—extra content—roughly every two years, keeping the game fresh, exciting, and full of new adventures. Each expansion introduces new lands and continents to explore, rich stories to experience, and sometimes even new races and classes to try out.
    <br>
        I’ve been playing since Vanilla (that’s what we call the base game from 2004, when it first released in North America) and have dabbled in most expansions since. I’m always drawn to the shiny new content, updated mechanics, and beautifully redesigned areas. The designers are truly masters of creation—the game is just stunning. My personal favorites are Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm, and Legion.
    <br>
    <br>
        Be sure to check out the cinematics for these expansions below—you won’t want to miss them!
