        <h2>Art Time!</h2>
    <hr>
        <p>
            Indie nail polish isn't just for regular manis. Indies allow for the utmost creativity from their wearers, especially when it comes to nail art.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are brands that make nail art supplies, too! Some of those supplies include:

        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://moyoulondon.com/" target=_blank>Stamping plates and jelly stampers</a></li>
            <li>Magnetic polishes and magnets</li>
            <li><a href="https://baronessx.com/collections/fluid-art-nail-polish">Watermarbling and fluid art tools</a></li>
            <li>Water decals and stamps</li>
        </ul>
        
           There’s truly no limit to what you can create in the world of nail art. Not sure what to do for your next mani? A quick scroll through Instagram or TikTok will spark endless inspiration. With the right supplies, you can design your own nail art without ever stepping foot in a salon. From watermarbling and stamping to freehand designs, the possibilities are endless. Indie polishes push the boundaries of what’s possible in a manicure—and when you mix in nail art, the creativity only expands. Some of my favorite looks have come from just experimenting and seeing where the polish takes me. If you don't like the way a nail turns out? That's fine. There's always acetone!

        <h3>Stamping Fun
        </h3>
    <hr>
        <p>I personally love stamping. Not all polishes, plates, or stampers are created equal, and part of the fun is figuring out what works best for you. You’ll quickly discover your go-to stamper or the perfect polish for fine-line designs. With so many stamping plates out there—from pop culture references to floral and abstract themes—it’s almost impossible to get bored. And if stamping isn’t your thing, that’s totally fine! There are plenty of other techniques to play with, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IIUtrzzkYs" target="_blank">watermarbling</a> or freehand art. The best part is that no matter which method you choose, your nails become a space to explore your own creativity.
