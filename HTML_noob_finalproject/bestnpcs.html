        <h2>Top Tier NPCs</h2>
        <hr>
    <p>
        Blizzard, over the years, has created some incredible characters. Their backstories are woven beautifully into the storylines, and you can’t help but feel for them. Even the bad ones.
        <br>
        <br>
        At this point, I’m not sure if I want to befriend them, date them, or be them. Life’s tough choices, yeah?
        <br>
        <br>
        What really makes WoW stand out is how much personality these NPCs bring to the game. They’re not just quest givers with an exclamation point over their heads — they’re legends in their own right. Whether it’s Sylvanas burning down a tree (yikes), Illidan reminding us that we are, in fact, not prepared, or Alexstrasza soaring in as a literal goddess-dragon, these characters stick with you.
        <br>
        <br>
        NPCs keep the story alive, push the drama, and give players those “oh wow” moments we never forget. Azeroth just wouldn’t be Azeroth without them.

        <b>Sylvanas Windrunner</b>
        <br>
            Sylvanas has always been that character—tragic, powerful, and a little terrifying. Once the proud Ranger-General of Silvermoon, she was turned into the Banshee Queen after Arthas killed her. Love her or hate her (and most players do both at some point), she’s one of the most complex and iconic figures in all of WoW.

        <br>
        <b>Illidan Stormrage</b>
        <br>
            “You are not prepared!” …and honestly, he’s right. Illidan’s the ultimate anti-hero: part demon, part night elf, all attitude. He made some questionable choices (locking him up for 10,000 years was maybe fair), but when Azeroth needed saving, Illidan was always there—on his own terms.

<br>
        <b>Alexstrasza the Life-Binder</b>
        <br>
            Alexstrasza is the Dragon Aspect of Life, which basically makes her Azeroth’s ultimate mom. She’s wise, powerful, and always puts the needs of the world before her own. Even after everything she’s been through, she’s still the definition of strength and compassion.

        <br>
        <b>Xal’atath, Blade of the Black Empire</b>
        <br>

            Creepy dagger that whispers in your ear? Yep, that’s Xal’atath. She’s tied to the Old Gods, loves stirring up trouble, and is way too smart for her own good. Every time she shows up, you just know something wild is about to happen. Honestly, I’m always a little excited (and a little nervous) to see where she pops up next.
