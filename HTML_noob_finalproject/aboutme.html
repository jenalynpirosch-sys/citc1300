            The name is Jenalyn, I was born in the 1900s, and I like things. I even love some things.

        <h3>About Some of Those Things</h3>
        <p>
            I am really good at 3 things: annoying my animals, listening to the same song on repeat for literal years, and having the attention span of a dead gnat.

            I'm also great at rewatching my favorite horror and sci fi movies. Prometheus. As Above So Below. Hell House LLC. The Core. They're just so good. We're coming up on Halloween which means there's horror flicks and shows popping up everywhere. I am THRIVING.
            <br>

            Gaming is rad. I have played World of Warcraft since launch and I absolutely love it. Now, I'm not the best fire mage out there, but I have fun. Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm, and Legion are my favorite expansions by far. The game is still really cool, but there's just something about the feel of those three specific launches. One could always play Classic since they're going through them on that side, but I do not wish to go through the slow level grind that comes with Classic and leveling mechanics. Nope. No thanks.

            For the Pokemon TCG, we love going to card shows and shops around the Middle TN area. On the weekend, my boyfriend and I try to find a new shop each time (and then come back and say our usual is better, naturally). When it comes to shows, if you're ever in the area, The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NashvilleSportsCardsAndCollectiblesShow" target="_blank">Nashville Sports Cards and Collectibles Show</a> hosts two shows each month in Antioch. They have a good amount of both sports cards and Pokemon cards and the folks are always super nice. The address can be found below!

<p class="spotify_text">Music is a very large part of my life - most people say that, but it's 100% true for me. It got me through school, through breakups, through a divorce. Through everything. The earliest memory I have is sitting on my dad's lap listening to Genesis and R.E.M. on his fancy (for '94) stereo and speaker setup. I quickly fell in love with sitting in a dark room listening to a single song just so I can appreciate it that much more. Not just that, but music was a large part of my blogging, too. I can't focus unless something was playing. That's the case now, too. I've had Your Idol playing on repeat for the last 4 or so hours (the whole KPDH soundtrack is fantastic). I wanted to share my On Repeat playlist from Spotify if any of y'all are audiophiles like I am. Enjoy!  </p>
