        <h1>Pokémon TCG - The hunt for shiny cardboard</h1>
    
    <hr>
    <h2>The quest for cool cards is endless</h2>
    <p>
        <br>

        Do you collect? What's your grail card?
    </p>

    <hr>

<h3>There are 1,025 unique Pokémon!</h3>

    <p>Isn't that wild? The cards debuted in Japan in 1995 with the launch of two Game Boy games. They traveled far and wide to make it to us in 1998, also with the release of Game Boy games. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I started collecting in late 1998, when I was 7. I no longer have my original binder but I have a sense of pride knowing that I did have a master base and Jungle set in my possession. This hobby is my happy place. I play the TCG virtually mostly, but I do have some decks that I've built on hand. Collecting cards has been incredibly healing for my inner child.I'm rebuilding all of the vintage sets - just picked up the base set holo <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/42382/pokemon-base-set-charizard?Language=English&page=1" target="_blank">Charizard</a>, which is the most expensive from base set, even if it's from the first reprint series labeled as unlimited. Isn't it a neat card?

    <p>There are so many amazing Pokémon cards out there, and new ones are releasing every few months. My poor bank account can't keep up. But hey, they are <i>trading</i> cards, after all. We have our very own trade binder that we take with us to card shows and meetups with our friends. There's a Pokémon for everyone; a card that you get may mean more to them than you. Trading is a ton of fun if you know what cards you're hoping to get!
    <br>
    <br>
    These are just a few of the cards on my ever-growing wishlist:</p>
