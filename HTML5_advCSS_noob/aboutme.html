        <h3>About Those Things</h3>
        <p>
            I am really good at 3 things: annoying my animals, listening to the same song on repeat for literal years, and having the attention span of a dead gnat.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm also great at rewatching my favorite horror and sci fi movies. Prometheus. As Above So Below. Hell House LLC. The Core. They're just so good! My poor boyfriend gets roped into watching Prometheus with me very frequently. Bless his heart.
            <br>
            <br>
            I think gaming is rad. I have played World of Warcraft since launch and I think it's fantastic. I'm terrible player, but I have all sorts of fun.

            For the Pokemon TCG, we love going to card shows and shops around the Middle TN area. We've found some really cool cards and made lots of friends. If you're ever in the area, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NashvilleSportsCardsAndCollectiblesShow">Nashville Sports Cards and Collectibles Show</a> hosts two shows each month in Antioch. They have a good amount of both sports card and Pokemon cards and the folks are always super nice. The address can be found below!

<p class="spotify-text">Music is a very large part of my life - most people say that, but it's 100% true for me. It got me through school, through breakups, through a divorce. Through everything. I have vivid memories of sitting on my dad's lap listening to Phil Collins on his fancy (for '94) stereo. It was a large part of my blogging, too. I couldn't focus unless something was playing. That's the case now, too. I've had Your Idol playing on repeat for the last 4 or so hours (the whole KPDH soundtrack is fantastic). I wanted to share my On Repeat playlist from Spotify if any of y'all are audiophiles like I am. Enjoy!  </p>
